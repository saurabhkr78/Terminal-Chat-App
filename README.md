 # iM18 Terminal Messenger

Anonymous Chatting with your friends using the terminal.

I built this project to securely chat with friends undetected. It looks cool and gives an aesthetic vibe when you chat with your peers using the terminal.

In this chatting application, you can keep your nickname and ban users just by putting the **ban <user-name/nickname>**

## Prerequisites
- Download the latest version of Python.
- Set the Python path in the Environment Variables window. Find the "Path" variable in the "System variables".
- Check the installation of Python using:
 ** python --version**

## Instructions to run the application

- Clone the repo.
- Open a Terminal or Command Prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo.
- In the terminal, run the server file using: **python server.py**
- Again open a new Terminal or Command Prompt window.
- Navigate to the same directory.
- In the terminal, run the client file using: **python client.py**

## Note
- To simulate multiple clients, open additional terminal windows, navigate to the same directory, and run client.py again in each new window. Each client will be able to send and receive messages.
